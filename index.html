            <p>
                I am an avid learner, daily Linux user, and innovative researcher. I am looking forward to learning new skills and to applying my talents to InfoSec.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 2em;">
                I am currently a student at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania planning to graduate in May 2016 with a double major in Digital Forensics and Anthropology.

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
                I have been a security enthusiast for years now. I jumped on the chance for penetration testing experience in college. I have also had the chance to do vulnerability assessment with a large company. For club activities I have worked on Linux system hardening and application sandboxing.

            <h3>Forensics</h3>
            <p>The core of our Digital Forensics degree at Bloomsburg is dead-box hard drive forensics. I learned filesystems and forensics processes from the ground up before learning tools. I have worked cases in EnCase, FTK and Autopsy. I have cracked passwords with PRTK and Hashcat, and created timelines with Log2Timeline. I enjoy the investigative aspect of digital forensics, finding clues and catching bad guys. My report writing skills are good and I have participated in a mock cross examination.

            <h3>Incident Response</h3>
            <p>
                Much like with dead-box, I enjoy the 'whodunit' aspect of incident response. The difference is that now the evidence is spread out over running systems, the network, memory and logs. I can have worked with all of these sources of evidence. I taught myself how to use Volatility, and it is my go-to tool for memory forensics. Outside of class I have done memory forensics and malware analysis on my own computers after one of them caught a virus. The virus was mining Bitcoins and I was able to identify what pool it was a part of and the ID of the user within that pool.

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>I enjoy coding and often do it either for fun or to solve problems. I originally taught myself Python, then learned Java in class. After that I pursued a number of other languages including C#, Golang, and Rust. I learned to read some assembly through a reverse engineering contest called Microcorruption. I use Bash for task automation on Linux and Powershell for Windows administration. </p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
                As an anthropologist I study vulnerable human behaviors, the community around the website 4Chan, and hacktivist groups like Anonymous. My training gives me a unique perspective on social engineering and security education. My research has given me insight into the threat posed by groups like Anonymous and Lulsec.
